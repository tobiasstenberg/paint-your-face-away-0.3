    The face detector couldn't detect a face. 
    <br><br>
    This does not necessarily mean your face evades all face detection systems.
    <br><br>

    Would you like to continue to paint your face without the detection function? 
    <br><br>
    Or
    <br><br>
    Would you like to upload another image?
    <br><br>

    Have you painted your face thoroughly?
    <br><br>

    When you do, the portrait can likely resist the scraping and your face could become more difficult to identify for facial recognition systems.
